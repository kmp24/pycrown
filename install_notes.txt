#git clone repo to local
git clone https://github.com/kmp24/pycrown.git


# code calls for 3.6 but packages need some updates, pip/setuptools have issues with 3.6 but 3.8 is close enough
conda create --name pycrown pthon=3.8

# gdal takes forever to install with conda, use libmamba to solve dependency issues
conda update -n base conda
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
conda install -c conda-forge gdal

then:
cd to 'pycrown' cloned from gh
#pip install C:\Users\kperham\work\development\pycrown

# do this instead in case you need to make changes to the package
pip install --upgrade -e .
